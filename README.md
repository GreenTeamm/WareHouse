# WareHouse

### User story

AS an employee I want to be able to view, edit, and delete stock

WHEN I want to see if an item is in stock

Then I can search for it

WHEN I want to see details on an item

THEN I can see color, fabric and price

WHEN an item leaves the store

THEN I can update the database

WHEN an item arrives in the store

THEN I can add it to the database

## Design Decissions

All routes apart form the login and signup are behind an auth wall.
This was done so only the comapny who owns the items can view their invenotry.

## Installation Instructions

To install run "npm i"
